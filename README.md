# open-pr
Swift tool to open a PR from command line. The command will open a new window (or a tab) in the default browser to the page where a new PR can be generated from the current branch against the default branch. The script needs to generate the actual URL that will do so.

# WIP
Please note that the work on this tool is currently in progress.

# Usage
Type `open-pr` in the folder directory from terminal. It will take you to the browser on "create new PR" page.
